```
This skin is based on Kenney's Ui pack : http://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-rpg-expansion 
The second image pack I used is  (I supported Kenney and bought the first asset pack) :

Great site ! Modern and good structured asset packs ! 

I used RAY3K's skin composer ... https://ray3k.wordpress.com/software/skin-composer-for-libgdx/
